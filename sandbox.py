#Drilled into us from a young age, ‘You should always tell the truth’ is a mantra that has been undeniably omnipresent in fables and fairytales that dotted our childhood. As children, being truthful was preached as the only correct option, with promises of imminent downfall like an extended Pinocchio’s nose to those who failed to comply. Even as we age, values of honesty and integrity are continually embedded in almost every moral code out there. While truthfulness should be practiced in most situations, a more realistic approach suggests that telling the truth may not always be the most viable choice. On a personal level, telling the truth is essential for overall well-being. Maintaining a clear conscience is essential for us to go about our daily lives without being plagued by guilt or anxiety that is inevitably derived from frequent lies. Constant feelings of misalignment from having to constantly juggle our untruths can quickly take a toll on our state of mind. Findings from a psychology project conducted by the University of Notre Dam showed that individuals who actively displayed sincerity and honesty in their daily lives faced considerably less physical ailments like headaches and an overall decrease in tension and stress levels. Furthermore, displaying integrity enables the establishment of healthy relationships, which are fundamental for our well-being. Being transparent to one another facilitates mutual trust and a more comfortable environment for the sharing of thoughts and feelings. As such, being truthful lays a crucial foundation for the stable functioning of us as individuals. Furthermore, from a political perspective, telling the truth enhances the credibility of leaders and candidates for positions of power. More often than not, political campaigns are rife with questions of truthfulness and lying. Many politicians pepper their speeches with tall claims and unsubstantiated promises in an attempt to portray themselves in the most ideal image possible. With the proliferation of social media rapidly uncovering problematic pasts of candidates previously stashed away from the eyes of the public, it is to no surprise that there has been a gravitation towards leaders that display high levels of integrity. This is evidently illustrated by the rise to success of Jacinda Arden, the youngest ever Prime Minister of New Zealand. Her party’s campaign outreach took a decidedly different approach from former party leaders- Arden established a unique connection to voters by communicating with people in an open and honest way, unlike that of a traditional politician. She engaged with voters on social media platforms, and proposed realistic national policies in a transparent manner. Her pragmatic approach and authenticity hence successfully convinced voters to believe in her vision for the country. Thus, it is essential for political candidates to maintain high levels of trustworthiness to maintain their credibility. Political leaders with honesty embedded as a core value are viewed by the general populous as more suitable candidates for leading a nation. However, we should not paint all situations with the same brush- such a claim is verly optimistic and cannot be applied to all situations. In some cases, not telling the truth is arguably justifiable. Being dishonest may sometimes be the more socially acceptable response when dealing with others in a respectable manner. White lies, for instance, are innocuous and serve as a preferable alternative to offensive remarks that could be deemed as impolite. Untruthfulness in such situations are considered as prosocial lies and have been scientifically proven to build a sense of benevolence between people. Lying out of consideration for another person’s feelings is a key part of maintaining harmonious relationships, as harsh truths can often do more harm than good. Hence, lies that do not carry malicious or self-serving intent can be justifiable if used from a standpoint of displaying empathy and compassion towards other individuals. As said by behavioural science professor Emma E. Levine, ‘People care about whether you have good intentions a lot more than whether the person is being honest per se.’ Moreover, when viewed from a societal standpoint, withholding the truth can be warranted if it is done in the interests of public welfare and security. Governmental bodies may disclose incomplete information or selectively reveal facts to citizens at calculated junctures as a means of protecting the larger community’s well-being, as obliged by their social contract. For instance, in the initial stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Chinese authorities did not reveal full details regarding the severity of the freshly spreading virus in Wuhan despite criticism from international media outlets. Such actions were intentional so as to prevent excessive public alarm in Wuhan. Immediately alerting locals would have caused a wildfire spread of COVID-19 to neighbouring regions as locals would likely flee back to their provinces out of fear. By momentarily withholding the full truth, authorities had more time to assess the situation and take necessary measures like mobilising the police to curb the spread of the virus as much as possible. Hence, in crises or similar precarious situations, it may be more viable for the truth to be withheld for the greater good and safety of society. In conclusion, it still generally rings true that the truth will almost always ‘set us free’. Speaking truths is essential for the improvement and progress of society as a whole. However, it is unreasonable to assume this of all situations- varying circumstances may sometimes suggest otherwise. Thus, ultimately, regardless of truth or untruth, underlying intentions still carry the most weight and always should be considered.
