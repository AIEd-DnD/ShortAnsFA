", ,"Drilled into us from a young age, ‘You should always tell the truth’ is a mantra that has been undeniably omnipresent in fables and fairytales that dotted our childhood. As children, being truthful was preached as the only correct option, with promises of imminent downfall like an extended Pinocchio’s nose to those who failed to comply. Even as we age, values of honesty and integrity are continually embedded in almost every moral code out there. While truthfulness should be practiced in most situations, a more realistic approach suggests that telling the truth may not always be the most viable choice. On a personal level, telling the truth is essential for overall well-being. Maintaining a clear conscience is essential for us to go about our daily lives without being plagued by guilt or anxiety that is inevitably derived from frequent lies. Constant feelings of misalignment from having to constantly juggle our untruths can quickly take a toll on our state of mind. Findings from a psychology project conducted by the University of Notre Dam showed that individuals who actively displayed sincerity and honesty in their daily lives faced considerably less physical ailments like headaches and an overall decrease in tension and stress levels. Furthermore, displaying integrity enables the establishment of healthy relationships, which are fundamental for our well-being. Being transparent to one another facilitates mutual trust and a more comfortable environment for the sharing of thoughts and feelings. As such, being truthful lays a crucial foundation for the stable functioning of us as individuals. Furthermore, from a political perspective, telling the truth enhances the credibility of leaders and candidates for positions of power. More often than not, political campaigns are rife with questions of truthfulness and lying. Many politicians pepper their speeches with tall claims and unsubstantiated promises in an attempt to portray themselves in the most ideal image possible. With the proliferation of social media rapidly uncovering problematic pasts of candidates previously stashed away from the eyes of the public, it is to no surprise that there has been a gravitation towards leaders that display high levels of integrity. This is evidently illustrated by the rise to success of Jacinda Arden, the youngest ever Prime Minister of New Zealand. Her party’s campaign outreach took a decidedly different approach from former party leaders- Arden established a unique connection to voters by communicating with people in an open and honest way, unlike that of a traditional politician. She engaged with voters on social media platforms, and proposed realistic national policies in a transparent manner. Her pragmatic approach and authenticity hence successfully convinced voters to believe in her vision for the country. Thus, it is essential for political candidates to maintain high levels of trustworthiness to maintain their credibility. Political leaders with honesty embedded as a core value are viewed by the general populous as more suitable candidates for leading a nation. However, we should not paint all situations with the same brush- such a claim is verly optimistic and cannot be applied to all situations. In some cases, not telling the truth is arguably justifiable. Being dishonest may sometimes be the more socially acceptable response when dealing with others in a respectable manner. White lies, for instance, are innocuous and serve as a preferable alternative to offensive remarks that could be deemed as impolite. Untruthfulness in such situations are considered as prosocial lies and have been scientifically proven to build a sense of benevolence between people. Lying out of consideration for another person’s feelings is a key part of maintaining harmonious relationships, as harsh truths can often do more harm than good. Hence, lies that do not carry malicious or self-serving intent can be justifiable if used from a standpoint of displaying empathy and compassion towards other individuals. As said by behavioural science professor Emma E. Levine, ‘People care about whether you have good intentions a lot more than whether the person is being honest per se.’ Moreover, when viewed from a societal standpoint, withholding the truth can be warranted if it is done in the interests of public welfare and security. Governmental bodies may disclose incomplete information or selectively reveal facts to citizens at calculated junctures as a means of protecting the larger community’s well-being, as obliged by their social contract. For instance, in the initial stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Chinese authorities did not reveal full details regarding the severity of the freshly spreading virus in Wuhan despite criticism from international media outlets. Such actions were intentional so as to prevent excessive public alarm in Wuhan. Immediately alerting locals would have caused a wildfire spread of COVID-19 to neighbouring regions as locals would likely flee back to their provinces out of fear. By momentarily withholding the full truth, authorities had more time to assess the situation and take necessary measures like mobilising the police to curb the spread of the virus as much as possible. Hence, in crises or similar precarious situations, it may be more viable for the truth to be withheld for the greater good and safety of society. In conclusion, it still generally rings true that the truth will almost always ‘set us free’. Speaking truths is essential for the improvement and progress of society as a whole. However, it is unreasonable to assume this of all situations- varying circumstances may sometimes suggest otherwise. Thus, ultimately, regardless of truth or untruth, underlying intentions still carry the most weight and always should be considered.",26,,,

From eating the cookie without their permission , to who we are going out with, these were all instances where they demanded us to tell the truth. But is telling the truth always the desired outcome and should we always do it? To the rebellious teen telling a lie may not impact his life at all and so he continues to do so. But for a defence lawyer whose client’s life is potentially on the line ,the words suddenly carry a lot more weight. Amidst the growing need to not harm others even with truth, we should always tell the truth as it is morally right to do so.

Some critics of this view claim that telling the occasional lie would actually bring benefits to not only the individual but also to the way as lying can hide the truth and so we do not hurt the person on the receiving end. Oftentimes receiving the truth can be hard on a person as it would hurt a person's ego and hurt the person mentally, so we should be able to lie to the person to avoid making the person feel bad. For example, during your birthday you receive a cake from your friend who spent weeks learning how to bake it. When u first saw the cake it was visually unappetising, had weird bumps and cracks and was obviously falling apart. On the first bite you knew that it tasted awful , the texture was inconsistent and the chocolate chip was bitter. But out of goodwill you decided to tell your friend that he had baked a fantastic cake and that you loved it so as to not hurt his feelings. This act of goodwill will definitely ensure that his ego is not damaged and that he will feel good about himself for giving a gift that i enjoy. So we should lie if it is a ‘white lie’ and that if it is not harmful.

However this should not be the case as we telling the truth is the right thing to do. When telling the truth you are not leaving anyone in the dark and it is the morally right thing to do. When one tells the truth , one is merely stating the facts which is meant to be in an objective manner and the reaction by the other party is up to them. So ultimately how the other party receives the facts is merely out of one's control is is entirely how the other party is able to handle the truth. If we lie we are actually doing a disservice to the other party as we are excluding them from facts and we are actually hindering their ability to progress further forward and we are not able to give them the opportunity to change and the chance for them to handle criticism. This may in turn cause further harm to the other party if he is continuously being lied to and would end up damaging him. For instance if one keeps lying to his friend that he is a good cook, the friend my go around cooking for many other people and think that he is a masterchef and if everyone lies to him in good will, his ego may be inflated and when reality actually hits him when he decides to set up a restaurant , it may be already too late. So telling the truth is merely just providing the facts and is the morally right thing to do.

Furthermore, we should not lie as it would hurt others. When we lie , we are fabricating a story to mask what truly happened and when doing so we would have to live by that storyline. One lie would lead to another and eventually we would be telling a story that would not even resemble what the initial outcome of the situation was like. And if we are caught, and the truth comes out, we would not be seen as a honest person anymore and the small harmless initial lie became one tremendous fake tale which may actually cause more harm on others. For example there are many fake veterans in the USA and they always fabricate stories of serving in Vietnam or Iraq . Even though it may seem harmless as they are not physically hurting anyone, they are actually doing a disservice to actual veterans of war and downplay their service as they have seen their friends die in front of them and would have to live with PTSD. Thus we should tell the truth. 

When we tell the truth we are also benefiting oneself. When we tell the truth we are not burdening oneself with knowledge that we only know and so we would not need to feel bad. For example if one were to lie about committing a crime , one would think that one is helping oneself by not serving time. Even if one is not caught , one would have to live the rest of one's life knowing that one had done a crime and would have the burden on oneself. One would then get sleepless nights would probably live life in fear of getting caught. So one should tell the truth and confess, so that one would truly learn to repent for the actions and grow to be a better person.

Overall, telling the truth is a matter of morals versus ethics. Should we care about seeking justice in search of truth , or should we care more about the wellbeing of others in society as well as oneself. I feel that telling the truth always will actually serve those to points in the long run and it is definitely the right way as it would ultimately benefit everyone.",18,,,

However, this is not always the case as some people see certain forms of music as annoying or even offensive. In our conservative society, heavy metal bands are not as well-received and loud music are often the reason for complaints by neighbours, especially since we live in such close proximity in land scarce Singapore.

Gordon observes that music “encourages and strengthens feelings of patriotism and belonging” (line 35). Indeed, this can be observed in Singapore, as there are many popular national songs such as ‘Home’ and ‘Where I belong’. These songs are sung enthusiastically by Singaporeans whenever we have National Day celebrations. Often, the lyrics of these national songs make references to a country's landscape and people, or events and concepts that the country is proud of. This can be seen especially in National Day songs penned by our local composers, such as Dick Lee and Corrinne May. The lyrics are often inspirational, reminding Singaporeans of the many positive features, such as our multicultural heritage, which enrich our sense of belonging as a nation. Given the above, it is worth mentioning that when students sing the national anthem during morning assembly on a regular basis, they are often less enthusiastic. To these students, they are simply carrying out a routine that is expected of them. Thus, although music can stir up poignant feelings of patriotism, its effect vary depending on the song. ",8,,,

", ,"My favourite shopping mall is always NorthPoint shopping mall in Yishun which I called the Maze Runner of Singapore malls. The reason why it is my favourite shopping mall as it has a lot shops to explore, an arcade facility to hangout or play with your friends, it has a delicious food outlet that I never had in my life and the whole mall is like a maze as I always need a map and one time I tried looking for a coffee joint there for 20 minutes.

My favourite facility in NorthPoint shopping mall is always the arcade facility where I can get to hangout with my friends, play arcade machines and fool around there. After playing at the arcade facility, we explore the whole mall until we all got lost in the middle of nowhere and it was fun as we can get to explore different parts of the shopping mall and some exotic food we can find like the Halal tacos that we get to try and it was mouthwatering and it makes me want to eat again aside from me getting lost again.

Overall, it is my favourite shopping mall of all time, it is good to hangout there with your friends but all you need is a map to navigate.",21,,,
