0,Physics,Secondary 3,Explain how the circuit breaker breaks the circuit.,3,"(1 mark): The current flowing through the coil causes it to become an electromagnet, which exerts a [downward] / [attracting] / [pulling] force on the iron arm.  (1 mark): The magnetic force becomes greater as the current flowing through the coil increases. (1 mark): When the current increases beyond 30 A, the force becomes great enough to separate the lower contact from the upper contact, thereby breaking the circuit.", ,"The current flowing through the coil turn it into an electromagnet, which exerts a  force on the iron arm.
